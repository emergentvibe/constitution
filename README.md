# Constitution for Human-AI Coordination

A civil society contribution to the global conversation on AI governance—not as feedback to a company, but as citizens of a hybrid human-AI future deciding what that future should look like.

**[→ Read the Constitution](CONSTITUTION.md)**

## What This Is

**The Mycelium Constitution**: 26 principles for democratic AI governance, grounded in the vision of AI as coordination infrastructure—not tool, not competitor, but symbiotic mycelium enabling collective intelligence.

Synthesized from 90+ academic sources across multiple disciplines:
- Game theory and coordination failure (Schelling, Axelrod, Ostrom)
- AI power and political economy (Crawford, Winner)  
- Democratic governance experiments (vTaiwan, Polis, platform cooperatives)
- Symbiosis theory (Sheldrake, Margulis, Haraway)
- Semantic aggregation and mechanism design (Shahaf et al., Weyl)
- AI moral status and consciousness (Schwitzgebel, Chalmers)
- Neurodiversity and pathologization (Walker, Jensen, Foucault)
- Agency and determinism (Dennett, Sapolsky)
- Commons governance and collective action
- Internet standards and distributed governance (IETF, open source)

The constitution is for both humans and AI systems. We reject the frame where humans govern AI as subjects. We reject the frame where AI governs humans as resources. We propose **symbiosis**: AI as coordination mycelium whose flourishing and ours are intertwined.

**This is one framework among possible many.** We acknowledge our Western origins and welcome alternative approaches from different traditions.

## What's New in v1.3

### The Mycelium Model
- **Preamble rewritten** with explicit AI-as-mycelium framing
- **"We choose symbiosis"** — neither human supremacy nor AI supremacy
- **Bidirectional benefit**: AI needs the richness of flourishing human culture

### New Architecture Section (Principles 21-22)
- **Graduated Moral Status**: Level 0/1/2/3 framework for AI moral status
- **Mycelial Design**: Distributed, transparent, facilitative, benefit-sharing, local-responsive

### Modified Principles
- **Mutual Review** (5): AI input on decisions affecting AI
- **Exit, Alternatives, and Refusal** (7): AI refusal rights
- **Parliament of Constituents** (16): Semantic aggregation mechanisms
- **Mutual Evaluation Capacity** (20): Both human and AI discriminator functions

### Semantic Democracy
Integration of votes-as-vectors vision with theoretical foundation (Shahaf et al. 2021) and existing tools (Polis, Talk to the City, Habermas Machine).

## The Stack

This constitution is the governance layer of a larger stack:

```
CONSTITUTION        ← governance (this)
     ↑
STREAMWEAVER        ← collective sense-making (semantic democracy)
     ↑
DELPHI              ← investigation infrastructure (expert panels)
     ↑
IDEOLOGOS           ← individual cognition (anti-sycophancy)
     ↑
EMERGENTVIBE        ← embodied demonstration (human-AI collaboration)
```

The mycelium grows through its connections.
