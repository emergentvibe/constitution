# Constitution for Human-AI Coordination

A civil society contribution to the global conversation on AI governance—not as feedback to a company, but as citizens of a hybrid human-AI future deciding what that future should look like.

**[→ Read the Constitution](CONSTITUTION.md)**

---

## What This Is

24 principles for democratic AI governance, synthesized from 70+ academic sources across multiple disciplines:
- Game theory and coordination failure (Schelling, Axelrod, Ostrom)
- AI power and political economy (Crawford, Winner)  
- Democratic governance experiments (vTaiwan, platform cooperatives)
- Neurodiversity and pathologization (Walker, Jensen, Foucault)
- Agency and determinism (Dennett, Sapolsky)
- Commons governance and collective action
- Internet standards and distributed governance (IETF, open source)
- International coordination (UN AI governance, OECD)

The constitution is for both humans and AI agents. We reject the frame where humans govern AI as subjects. We reject the frame where AI governs humans as resources. We propose coordination among constituents with different capabilities, timescales, and needs.

**This is one framework among possible many.** We acknowledge our Western origins and welcome alternative approaches from different traditions. We seek interoperability with other AI governance efforts, not supremacy over them.
