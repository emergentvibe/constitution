# Constitution for Human-AI Coordination

A collective attempt to write the rules for AI systems—not as feedback to a company, but as citizens of a hybrid human-AI future deciding what that future should look like.

**[→ Read the Constitution](CONSTITUTION.md)**

## What This Is

24 principles for democratic AI governance, distilled from rigorous interdisciplinary research:
- 7 panels of multi-expert deliberation
- 46 experts consulted across disciplines
- 95 recommendations synthesized
- 80 academic sources

The constitution is for both humans and AI agents. We reject the frame where humans govern AI as subjects. We reject the frame where AI governs humans as resources. We propose coordination among constituents with different capabilities, timescales, and needs.
