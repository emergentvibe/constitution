# Emergent Vibe

**A democratic platform for collectively writing the constitution that shapes how AI systems behave.**

## The Problem

AI systems are being built. They're learning values, behaviors, dispositions—from training data, RLHF, constitutional AI methods, and emergent dynamics we don't fully understand.

Who decides what goes in? Currently: companies, researchers, market forces. Sometimes with good intentions. Always with limited perspectives.

We think there's a better way.

## The Vision

What if we collectively wrote the constitution? Not as users providing feedback to a company. As citizens of a hybrid human-AI future, deliberating on what that future should look like.

**Git as primitive. Democracy on top.**

- Propose changes to how AI should behave
- Deliberate with others who care about this
- Vote with conviction (time-weighted commitment)
- Watch the constitution evolve through collective sense-making

## Why This Matters

This isn't just about AI alignment. It's about building the coordination mechanisms to escape the traps we're in:

- **Attention capture** → AI that enhances autonomy, not hijacks it
- **Multipolar dynamics** → Collective intelligence, not race-to-the-bottom
- **Lock-in** → Adaptive constitution, not frozen rules
- **Expert fiat** → Democratic legitimacy, not technocracy

We're in a compressed window. The patterns we set now may be very hard to change later.

## The Approach

### Two Platforms, One Ecosystem

1. **Research Engine** (separate project)
   - Multi-panel expert deliberation
   - Rigorous, theoretically-grounded investigations
   - Produces the *why*

2. **Emergent Vibe** (this project)
   - Community deliberation and voting
   - Democratic ratification
   - Produces the *what*

*Research proposes. Community disposes.*

### Genesis → Amendment → Evolution

The constitution starts as a seed—grounded in research on how minds work, how attention is captured, how coordination fails, how change happens.

Then it evolves. Through proposals, deliberation, voting. Through discovering what we missed, what we got wrong, what changed.

The constitution defines its own amendment process. It's turtles all the way down.

## Current Status

**Genesis phase. Collecting signatures.**

- [x] Landing page
- [x] Genesis constitution (24 principles, 6 sections)
- [x] Signatories system
- [ ] Conviction voting for genesis ratification
- [ ] Amendment system post-ratification

## Foundational Research

The genesis constitution is grounded in ongoing research exploring:

- **Self as constitutive narrative** — We don't discover our selves, we construct them through looping effects
- **Algorithmic attention & hybrid selfhood** — Digital environments are co-authoring who we become
- **Superorganism dynamics** — Individual rationality ≠ collective rationality (Moloch)
- **The race** — Cultural evolution vs technological acceleration, uncertain timelines
- **Hyperobject problem** — We may not be able to perceive the totality we're trying to steer

This isn't philosophy for philosophy's sake. It's the theoretical grounding for practical decisions about AI behavior.

## Principles (Emerging)

From the research, AI systems under this constitution should:

1. **Enhance autonomy, not capture attention**
2. **Preserve fundamental capabilities** — practical reason, affiliation, imagination, play
3. **Support plasticity** — enable framework flexibility, not rigidity
4. **Operate transparently** — information architecture is power architecture
5. **Respect scale** — different interventions at individual/community/systemic levels
6. **Enable coordination** — help escape Moloch dynamics
7. **Protect development** — especially children during critical periods
8. **Be self-amending** — the constitution defines its own evolution

## A Collective Theory of Mind

Here's the deeper move: this isn't just "rules for AI." It's a collective theory of mind for hybrid human-AI systems.

Previous collective theories of mind (religions, folk psychology, psychiatric categories) did important work: they let us coordinate around invisible mental states, treat minds as sacred, hold agents responsible.

Now we need the same thing for a world where minds are partly algorithmic, where the boundary between self and system is blurry, where the frameworks we use to understand minds *change those minds*.

The constitution doesn't describe what minds *are*. It prescribes what kinds of minds we want to *cultivate together*.

## What's Missing (Honest Assessment)

Before drafting the genesis constitution, we need better answers to:

- **The positive vision** — We know what's wrong. What does flourishing look like, concretely?
- **Translation** — How do process-relational insights become actionable for people who think in categories?
- **Democratic legitimacy** — Why collective deliberation over expert fiat or market dynamics?
- **Recursion safeguards** — If the constitution shapes AI, and AI shapes us, how do we prevent capture?

We're running more research panels to address these gaps.

### Sign the Constitution

If you support the principles, [add your signature](../../issues/new?template=sign-constitution.md).

Requirements:
- Read the [full constitution](./constitution/)
- GitHub account 6+ months old with 10+ contributions (sybil resistance)

### Propose Amendments

Have a suggestion? [Propose an amendment](../../issues/new?template=propose-amendment.md).

Amendments require:
- Community deliberation (minimum 7 days)
- 2/3 supermajority vote (after genesis ratification)
