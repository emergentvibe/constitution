# Constitution for Human-AI Coordination

A collective attempt to write the rules for AI systems—not as feedback to a company, but as citizens of a hybrid human-AI future deciding what that future should look like.

**[→ Read the Constitution](CONSTITUTION.md)**

---

## What This Is

24 principles for democratic AI governance, synthesized from 68 academic sources across multiple disciplines:
- Game theory and coordination failure (Schelling, Axelrod, Ostrom)
- AI power and political economy (Crawford, Winner)  
- Democratic governance experiments (vTaiwan, platform cooperatives)
- Neurodiversity and pathologization (Walker, Jensen, Foucault)
- Agency and determinism (Dennett, Sapolsky)
- Commons governance and collective action

The constitution is for both humans and AI agents. We reject the frame where humans govern AI as subjects. We reject the frame where AI governs humans as resources. We propose coordination among constituents with different capabilities, timescales, and needs.
