# VI. Revision and Enforcement

How the constitution evolves and takes effect.

---

## Principle 21: Regular Amendment

**Participatory revision every 2 years using deliberative democracy tools.**

The constitution is living, not frozen:

- **Scheduled revision**: Every 2 years, systematic review of all principles
- **Deliberative process**: Not just voting, but structured deliberation (citizens assemblies, Pol.is-style consensus mapping, expert input phases)
- **Participatory**: Open to all who meet sybil-resistance thresholds, not just elites
- **Documented**: All deliberation recorded, reasoning transparent, dissent preserved

Between scheduled revisions, amendments can be proposed at any time through the standard process (see below).

**Grounding**: Panel 6 (AI Governance) - vTaiwan as deliberative democracy model; constitutional process as ongoing, not one-time; 2-year cycle balances stability with adaptation.

## Principle 22: Certification and Compliance

**Certified systems receive preferential treatment; non-certified face restrictions.**

The constitution has teeth through certification:

- **Certification process**: Independent assessment of whether AI systems comply with constitutional principles
- **Preferential treatment**: Certified systems eligible for public procurement, partnership with municipal networks, reduced liability exposure
- **Restrictions**: Non-certified systems face procurement bans, increased regulatory scrutiny, civil liability exposure
- **Transparency**: Certification status and assessment details publicly available

This creates market incentives for compliance without requiring universal agreement.

**Grounding**: Panel 6 (AI Governance) - make democracy cheaper and extraction expensive through regulation, procurement, liability; certification as enforcement mechanism; coalition strategy creates market pressure.

## Principle 23: Enforcement Mechanisms

**Multiple reinforcing mechanisms: regulatory penalties, civil liability, collective bargaining pressure, municipal non-adoption, algorithmic audits, cultural stigma.**

No single enforcement mechanism is sufficient. Constitutional principles are enforced through:

- **Regulatory penalties**: Fines, operational restrictions, required remediation
- **Civil liability**: Private right of action for harms from non-compliant systems
- **Collective bargaining**: Unions and creator organizations refuse to work with non-compliant systems
- **Municipal non-adoption**: City networks refuse to deploy or integrate non-compliant systems
- **Algorithmic audits**: Independent technical assessment with public reporting
- **Cultural stigma**: Social disapproval of companies that violate constitutional principles

These mechanisms reinforce each other. Regulatory penalties make civil liability easier to prove. Municipal non-adoption creates market pressure. Cultural stigma affects talent recruitment.

**Grounding**: Panel 6 (AI Governance) - coalition power as enforcement; multiple mechanisms necessary because any single one can be captured or circumvented; Panel 2 (Game Theory) - changing payoffs to shift Nash equilibrium.

## Principle 24: Coalition Power

**Enforced through organized coalitions: tech workers, creators, labor, civil society, municipal networks. Architecture alone is insufficient.**

The constitution is enforced by organized people, not just by rules:

- **Tech workers**: Can refuse to build systems that violate principles, organize within companies
- **Creators**: Can withhold content from non-compliant training, collectively license through democratic terms
- **Labor**: Can negotiate AI deployment terms in contracts, strike over violations
- **Civil society**: Can mobilize public pressure, coordinate campaigns, provide monitoring
- **Municipal networks**: Can create alternative infrastructure, demonstrate different possibilities

Architecture matters - good rules make enforcement easier. But rules without organized power behind them are suggestions. Power requires coalition: diverse groups finding common cause.

**Target scale**: 50-100 cities + 1M+ creators + 100K+ workers = companies must comply or lose access to markets, talent, content, infrastructure.

**Grounding**: Panel 6 (AI Governance) - coalition strategy as highest leverage; Panel 4 - historical movements required material base and organized power; Panel 7 - "don't do this alone" as key guidance.

## Amendment Process

### Genesis Ratification

The initial constitution (v1.0) is ratified through:

1. **Publication**: Full text made available for review (30 days)
2. **Deliberation**: Open discussion, questions, proposed modifications
3. **Conviction voting**: 30-day voting period with time-weighted commitment
4. **Threshold**: Simple majority of participating voters (with minimum participation threshold)
5. **Ratification**: If threshold met, constitution becomes active

### Standard Amendment

After genesis ratification, amendments follow:

1. **Proposal**: Any participant can propose amendments
2. **Deliberation**: Minimum 7-day deliberation period
3. **Voting**: Amendments require 2/3 supermajority
4. **Implementation**: Approved amendments take effect after 14-day implementation period
5. **Documentation**: All amendments, deliberation, and voting records permanently preserved

### Emergency Amendment

For urgent safety concerns:

1. **Emergency proposal**: Flagged as emergency with detailed justification
2. **Expedited deliberation**: 48-hour minimum deliberation
3. **Higher threshold**: 3/4 supermajority required
4. **Automatic sunset**: Emergency amendments expire after 90 days unless ratified through standard process

### Unamendable Provisions

Certain provisions cannot be amended without dissolving and reconstituting the entire constitution:

- Principle 1 (Human Agency Preservation)
- Principle 2 (Collective Governance)
- Principle 21 (Regular Amendment)

These are load-bearing walls. Everything else can change; these define what "this constitution" means.
