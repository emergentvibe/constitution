# VII. Revision

How the constitution evolves.

---

## Principle 23: Adaptive Cycles

**Participatory revision on cycles appropriate to constituent lifecycles. The constitution adapts to the pace of its constituents.**

### The Problem

Static constitutions become outdated. But constitutions that change too easily lose their coordinating function—if rules might be different tomorrow, they can't anchor expectations today.

Pérez (2002) documents how institutions lag technological change by 20-30 years [S30]. AI is accelerating faster than traditional governance can adapt. We need revision mechanisms that are neither frozen nor chaotic.

### The Response

**Current cycle:** Every 2 years, participatory revision using deliberative democracy tools, including semantic aggregation where feasible (Principle 16).

**Adaptation:** As AI lifecycles accelerate, revision cycles may compress. Different constituent types (humans, AI systems, organizations) have different temporal scales. The constitution's revision rhythm should accommodate these differences.

**Process:** Standard amendments through 7-day deliberation and 2/3 supermajority. Emergency amendments through expedited 48-hour process with 3/4 supermajority and automatic 90-day sunset.

Taiwan's vTaiwan demonstrates that deliberative processes can work at speed [S63]. Ostrom's commons governance shows that successful institutions evolve through practice [S40].

## Principle 24: Certification

**Certified systems receive preferential treatment (procurement, partnership, reduced liability). Non-certified face restrictions. Certification creates market incentives for compliance.**

### The Problem

Voluntary ethical principles without enforcement are suggestions, not governance. But mandatory global regulation faces coordination failures across jurisdictions.

The OECD (2025) framework proposes certification as a middle path—market incentives rather than legal mandates [S66]. Companies seeking access to markets, talent, and partnerships have reason to comply even without universal agreement.

### The Response

**Certified systems receive:**
- Preferential treatment in public procurement
- Access to constitutional coalition partnerships
- Reduced liability exposure (good faith compliance defense)
- Reputational benefits and talent attraction

**Non-certified systems face:**
- Restrictions in municipal procurement (50-100 cities target)
- Exclusion from coalition partnerships
- Higher scrutiny and liability exposure
- Reputational costs

**Certification criteria** develop through Phase 2 practice. They assess compliance on a gradient—perfection is not required. The criteria are public, contestable, and revisable through adaptive cycles.

## Principle 25: Enforcement Mechanisms

**Multiple reinforcing mechanisms: regulatory penalties, civil liability, collective bargaining pressure, municipal non-adoption, algorithmic audits, cultural stigma. No single mechanism is sufficient; they reinforce each other.**

### The Problem

Any single enforcement mechanism can be evaded or captured. Regulatory penalties can be absorbed as cost of business. Civil liability faces proof problems. Collective bargaining requires ongoing organization. Municipal action faces resource constraints.

Piven & Cloward (1977) showed that successful movements use multiple pressure vectors simultaneously [S37]. Schelling (1960) demonstrated that coordination requires focal points but also credible consequences [S18].

### The Response

**Layer enforcement mechanisms:**

1. **Regulatory penalties**: Where applicable law exists, use it. Advocate for stronger regulation over time.

2. **Civil liability**: Documented harms create exposure. Class actions aggregate individual claims.

3. **Collective bargaining**: Workers refuse non-compliant systems. Creators withhold training data. Communities reject deployments.

4. **Municipal non-adoption**: Cities exclude non-certified systems from procurement. Network effects compound.

5. **Algorithmic audits**: Independent assessment reveals violations. Publication creates pressure.

6. **Cultural stigma**: Reputation costs for non-compliance. Talent refuses to work on problematic systems.

No single mechanism is sufficient. They reinforce each other: regulatory pressure creates legal risk; civil liability creates financial risk; collective bargaining creates operational risk; municipal exclusion creates market risk; audits create information; cultural stigma creates social risk.

## Principle 26: Coalition Power

**Enforced through organized coalitions: tech workers, creators, labor, civil society, municipal networks. Rules without organized power behind them are suggestions.**

### The Problem

Architecture matters, but architecture without enforcement is aspiration. Yudkowsky (2017) describes "inadequate equilibria"—situations where everyone sees the problem but no one can unilaterally fix it [S24].

Breaking inadequate equilibria requires organized collective action. Individual actors face coordination failures; coalitions can move together.

### The Response

**Coalition targets:**
- **50-100 cities**: Municipal networks (Eurocities, C40) coordinating procurement standards
- **1M creators**: Artists, writers, developers whose work trains AI systems
- **100K workers**: Tech workers, researchers, operators who build and deploy AI

**At scale, this coalition has leverage:**
- Companies must comply or lose market access
- Companies must comply or lose talent
- Companies must comply or lose content for training
- Companies must comply or lose operational capacity

**Coalition building requires:**
- Clear value proposition for joining
- Coordination infrastructure (communication, decision-making)
- Visible wins that demonstrate power
- Protection for members facing retaliation

Wilson & Wilson (2007) summarize: "Selfishness beats altruism within groups. Altruistic groups beat selfish groups" [S4]. Coalition power is how groups outcompete defection.

## Amendment Process

### Participation Tiers

Different levels of participation require different verification, balancing openness with coordination integrity:

**Tier 1: Deliberation (Open)**
Anyone can participate in discussion, propose ideas, and contribute to rough consensus. No formal verification required. This is where ideas are tested.

**Tier 2: Amendment Voting (Organizational)**
Voting on constitutional amendments requires organizational membership—verified affiliation with a signatory organization (city, cooperative, civil society org, AI lab, union). Organizations vouch for their members.

**Tier 3: Enforcement Decisions (Certified)**
Participation in enforcement decisions (certification revocation, sanctions) requires certified signatory status with demonstrated track record. Higher stakes require higher verification.

This tiered approach provides Sybil resistance without requiring perfect identity systems [S71]. It follows successful models from labor unions (membership rolls), professional associations (credentialing), and commons governance (community verification) [S40].

### Standard Amendment

After ratification:
1. **Proposal**: Any Tier 1 participant can propose amendments
2. **Deliberation**: Minimum 7-day period for Tier 1 discussion
3. **Voting**: 2/3 supermajority of Tier 2 participants required
4. **Implementation**: 14-day period before effect
5. **Documentation**: All deliberation records preserved and public

### Emergency Amendment

For urgent safety situations:
1. **Emergency criteria**: Must specify concrete, imminent harm—not hypothetical risk
2. **Expedited deliberation**: 48-hour minimum
3. **Higher threshold**: 3/4 supermajority of Tier 2 participants
4. **Automatic sunset**: Expires after 90 days unless ratified through standard process
5. **Post-hoc review**: All emergency amendments reviewed in next regular cycle

Emergency provisions exist for genuine crises, not convenience. Abuse of emergency procedures is grounds for enforcement action.

### Unamendable Core

These cannot be amended without dissolving and reconstituting the entire constitution:
- Principle 1 (Agency Preservation)
- Principle 2 (Collective Governance)
- Principle 23 (Adaptive Cycles)

These are load-bearing walls. Everything else can change.

### Reconstitution

If fundamental change is needed—if the unamendable core itself requires revision—the constitution provides for its own dissolution:
1. **Reconstitution proposal**: Requires 80% supermajority of Tier 2 participants
2. **Constitutional convention**: New founding process with founding protections
3. **Continuity**: Existing signatories may choose to join new constitution or not
4. **Transparency**: Full documentation of why reconstitution was needed

This is the escape valve. Constitutions that cannot change become prisons.
