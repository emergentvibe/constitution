# VI. Revision

How the constitution evolves and takes effect.

---

## Principle 21: Adaptive Cycles

**Participatory revision on cycles appropriate to constituent lifecycles. For current human-AI coordination: every 2 years using deliberative democracy tools.**

### The Problem

Fixed constitutions become obsolete. Pérez (2002) documents 50-60 year technological revolution cycles, with institutions lagging 20-30 years behind [S30]. AI may accelerate this further.

But constant revision creates instability. Ostrom (1990) found that successful commons governance requires rules that are stable enough to be learned but flexible enough to adapt [S40].

### The Response

Scheduled revision cycles balance stability with adaptation. For current human-AI coordination, 2-year cycles allow learning from experience. As AI lifecycles accelerate, revision cycles may need to compress.

Taiwan's vTaiwan uses deliberative democracy tools—Pol.is for consensus mapping, structured deliberation phases, radical transparency [S63]. Revision should be participatory, documented, and accessible.

## Principle 22: Certification

**Certified systems receive preferential treatment; non-certified face restrictions.**

### The Problem

Principles without enforcement are suggestions. Yudkowsky (2017) describes "inadequate equilibria"—stable situations where everyone knows things are bad but no one can unilaterally improve them [S24].

Shifting equilibria requires changing incentives, not just stating values.

### The Response

Certification creates market incentives:

**For certified systems**:
- Eligible for public procurement
- Partnership with municipal networks
- Reduced liability exposure
- Reputational benefits

**For non-certified systems**:
- Excluded from government contracts
- Increased regulatory scrutiny
- Greater civil liability exposure

The OECD framework (2025) provides structure for certification regimes [S66]. If enough municipalities and governments require certification, market pressure drives compliance regardless of individual company preferences.

## Principle 23: Enforcement Mechanisms

**Multiple reinforcing mechanisms: regulatory penalties, civil liability, collective bargaining pressure, municipal non-adoption, algorithmic audits, cultural stigma.**

### The Problem

Schelling (1960) showed that coordination problems require focal points—clear standards everyone can coordinate around [S18]. But focal points alone don't shift behavior; payoffs must change.

Axelrod (1984) demonstrated that cooperation emerges in iterated games with reputation effects [S20]. Single mechanisms can be captured; multiple mechanisms reinforce each other.

### The Response

Enforcement through multiple channels:
- **Regulatory penalties**: Fines, operational restrictions
- **Civil liability**: Private right of action for harms
- **Collective bargaining**: Unions refuse to work with non-compliant systems
- **Municipal non-adoption**: City networks exclude non-compliant systems
- **Algorithmic audits**: Independent technical assessment
- **Cultural stigma**: Reputational costs, talent recruitment difficulty

These mechanisms reinforce each other. Regulatory findings become evidence in civil cases. Municipal non-adoption creates market pressure. Cultural stigma affects hiring.

## Principle 24: Coalition Power

**Enforced through organized coalitions: tech workers, creators, labor, civil society, municipal networks. Architecture alone insufficient.**

### The Problem

Piven & Cloward (1977) showed that "disruption, not mass organization, is the chief mechanism by which poor people's movements win reforms" [S37]. Rules without organized power behind them are suggestions.

Wilson & Wilson (2007) summarize multilevel selection: "Selfishness beats altruism within groups. Altruistic groups beat selfish groups" [S4]. Constitutional enforcement requires groups organized for collective action.

### The Response

The constitution is enforced by organized people:
- **Tech workers**: Can refuse to build violating systems
- **Creators**: Can withhold content from non-compliant training
- **Labor**: Can negotiate AI deployment terms
- **Civil society**: Can mobilize public pressure
- **Municipal networks**: Can create alternative infrastructure

brown (2017) describes "critical connections over critical mass"—the quality of relationships matters as much as numbers [S41].

Target scale: 50-100 cities + 1M+ creators + 100K+ workers = companies must comply or lose access to markets, talent, content, infrastructure.

## Amendment Process

### Genesis Ratification
1. **Publication**: Full text available (30 days)
2. **Deliberation**: Open discussion and proposed modifications
3. **Conviction voting**: Time-weighted commitment
4. **Threshold**: Simple majority with minimum participation
5. **Ratification**: Constitution activates if threshold met

### Standard Amendment
1. **Proposal**: Any participant can propose
2. **Deliberation**: Minimum 7-day period
3. **Voting**: 2/3 supermajority required
4. **Implementation**: 14-day period before effect
5. **Documentation**: All records preserved

### Emergency Amendment
1. **Emergency flag**: Detailed justification required
2. **Expedited deliberation**: 48-hour minimum
3. **Higher threshold**: 3/4 supermajority
4. **Automatic sunset**: Expires after 90 days unless ratified normally

### Unamendable Provisions
These cannot be amended without reconstituting the entire constitution:
- Principle 1 (Agency Preservation)
- Principle 2 (Collective Governance)
- Principle 21 (Adaptive Cycles)

These are load-bearing walls.
