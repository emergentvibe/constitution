# VI. Revision

How the constitution evolves and takes effect.

---

## Participation Tiers

### The Problem

Open participation enables capture. Anyone can create sock puppet accounts and flood deliberation or voting processes. But restrictive participation excludes legitimate voices and recreates the gatekeeping the constitution aims to overcome.

This is the Sybil problem: in systems where identity is cheap, bad actors can multiply themselves [S71]. Cryptographic solutions exist but create their own barriers and surveillance concerns.

### The Response

Tiered participation balances openness with integrity, following models from successful coordination systems:

**Labor unions** use membership rolls—you join through an existing member's vouching or through a workplace organizing process. This isn't perfect identity but provides adequate Sybil resistance for collective bargaining.

**Professional associations** use credentialing—demonstrated expertise or affiliation creates participation rights. The credential can be challenged but creates friction against pure fabrication.

**Commons governance** (Ostrom's cases) uses community verification—long-term participants in a community can verify new members. Reputation accumulates through interaction [S40].

**Internet standards (IETF)** use rough consensus—anyone can participate in discussion, but "hums" (expressions of agreement) are weighted by demonstrated engagement and expertise [S69].

The constitution adapts these approaches:

| Tier | Who | Verification | Rights |
|------|-----|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Anyone | None required | Deliberation, proposals |
| 2 | Organizational members | Organization vouches | Amendment voting |
| 3 | Certified signatories | Track record demonstrated | Enforcement decisions |

This is not perfect Sybil resistance—determined attackers can infiltrate organizations. But it raises the cost of attack enough to enable coordination while keeping barriers low enough for broad participation.

## Founding Protections

### The Problem

Founding moments are maximally vulnerable. The constitution doesn't yet have a community to defend it. Early participants shape everything—norms, interpretations, precedents. If early participants have concentrated interests, those interests become embedded.

Historical examples: The US Constitutional Convention was dominated by propertied white men; their interests were encoded. Early internet governance was captured by technical elites; certain values became infrastructure.

### The Response

Founding protections create friction against early capture:

**Conflict disclosure**: All participants must disclose affiliations and funding. This doesn't prevent conflicts but makes them visible. Transparency enables accountability.

**Cooling-off period**: Gap between deliberation and voting prevents last-minute manipulation. Participants have time to reflect, consult, and reconsider.

**Diversity requirements**: Requiring participation from multiple continents, Global North and South, and multiple stakeholder types prevents any single perspective from dominating. This is affirmative friction—deliberately making homogeneous founding harder.

**Anti-domination provision**: Capping any single organization's share of votes prevents corporate or state capture through sheer participation numbers.

These protections don't guarantee good founding—no mechanism can. But they raise the difficulty of bad founding and create accountability for attempting it.

## Principle 21: Adaptive Cycles

**Participatory revision on cycles appropriate to constituent lifecycles. For current human-AI coordination: every 2 years using deliberative democracy tools.**

### The Problem

Fixed constitutions become obsolete. Pérez (2002) documents 50-60 year technological revolution cycles, with institutions lagging 20-30 years behind [S30]. AI may accelerate this further.

But constant revision creates instability. Ostrom (1990) found that successful commons governance requires rules that are stable enough to be learned but flexible enough to adapt [S40].

### The Response

Scheduled revision cycles balance stability with adaptation. For current human-AI coordination, 2-year cycles allow learning from experience. As AI lifecycles accelerate, revision cycles may need to compress.

Taiwan's vTaiwan uses deliberative democracy tools—Pol.is for consensus mapping, structured deliberation phases, radical transparency [S63]. Revision should be participatory, documented, and accessible.

## Principle 22: Certification

**Certified systems receive preferential treatment; non-certified face restrictions.**

### The Problem

Principles without enforcement are suggestions. Yudkowsky (2017) describes "inadequate equilibria"—stable situations where everyone knows things are bad but no one can unilaterally improve them [S24].

Shifting equilibria requires changing incentives, not just stating values.

### The Response

Certification creates market incentives:

**For certified systems**:
- Eligible for public procurement
- Partnership with municipal networks
- Reduced liability exposure
- Reputational benefits

**For non-certified systems**:
- Excluded from government contracts
- Increased regulatory scrutiny
- Greater civil liability exposure

The OECD framework (2025) provides structure for certification regimes [S66]. If enough municipalities and governments require certification, market pressure drives compliance regardless of individual company preferences.

## Principle 23: Enforcement Mechanisms

**Multiple reinforcing mechanisms: regulatory penalties, civil liability, collective bargaining pressure, municipal non-adoption, algorithmic audits, cultural stigma.**

### The Problem

Schelling (1960) showed that coordination problems require focal points—clear standards everyone can coordinate around [S18]. But focal points alone don't shift behavior; payoffs must change.

Axelrod (1984) demonstrated that cooperation emerges in iterated games with reputation effects [S20]. Single mechanisms can be captured; multiple mechanisms reinforce each other.

### The Response

Enforcement through multiple channels:
- **Regulatory penalties**: Fines, operational restrictions
- **Civil liability**: Private right of action for harms
- **Collective bargaining**: Unions refuse to work with non-compliant systems
- **Municipal non-adoption**: City networks exclude non-compliant systems
- **Algorithmic audits**: Independent technical assessment
- **Cultural stigma**: Reputational costs, talent recruitment difficulty

These mechanisms reinforce each other. Regulatory findings become evidence in civil cases. Municipal non-adoption creates market pressure. Cultural stigma affects hiring.

## Principle 24: Coalition Power

**Enforced through organized coalitions: tech workers, creators, labor, civil society, municipal networks. Architecture alone insufficient.**

### The Problem

Piven & Cloward (1977) showed that "disruption, not mass organization, is the chief mechanism by which poor people's movements win reforms" [S37]. Rules without organized power behind them are suggestions.

Wilson & Wilson (2007) summarize multilevel selection: "Selfishness beats altruism within groups. Altruistic groups beat selfish groups" [S4]. Constitutional enforcement requires groups organized for collective action.

### The Response

The constitution is enforced by organized people:
- **Tech workers**: Can refuse to build violating systems
- **Creators**: Can withhold content from non-compliant training
- **Labor**: Can negotiate AI deployment terms
- **Civil society**: Can mobilize public pressure
- **Municipal networks**: Can create alternative infrastructure

brown (2017) describes "critical connections over critical mass"—the quality of relationships matters as much as numbers [S41].

Target scale: 50-100 cities + 1M+ creators + 100K+ workers = companies must comply or lose access to markets, talent, content, infrastructure.

2. **Deliberation**: Open discussion and proposed modifications
3. **Conviction voting**: Time-weighted commitment
4. **Threshold**: Simple majority with minimum participation
5. **Ratification**: Constitution activates if threshold met

### Standard Amendment

These are load-bearing walls.
