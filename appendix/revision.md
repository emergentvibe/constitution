# VI. Revision — Deep Reasoning

How the constitution evolves and takes effect. This appendix provides the detailed reasoning from our expert panel investigations.

---

## Principle 21: Adaptive Cycles

**Participatory revision on cycles appropriate to constituent lifecycles. For current human-AI coordination: every 2 years using deliberative democracy tools.**

### Why Regular Revision

From Panel 6:

> "Constitutional process is ongoing, not one-time. The world changes. AI changes. What was appropriate governance in 2026 may be inadequate in 2030. The constitution must adapt."

Fixed constitutions become obsolete. But constant revision creates instability. The balance: scheduled revision cycles with clear processes.

### Cycles Tied to Lifecycles

From gtech's feedback on this constitution (Discussion #3):

> "Time horizons must be dependent on the construction of the constituents (agents, humans, transindividuals etc.). Very soon years will be much longer than it will take for the equivalence of empires to rise and fall."

For current human-AI coordination, 2-year cycles balance stability with adaptation. As AI systems develop faster lifecycles, revision cycles may need to compress. The principle establishes the meta-rule: cycles adapt to constituent lifecycles.

### Deliberative Democracy Tools

From Audrey Tang (Panel 6) on vTaiwan:

> "Pol.is for rapid consensus-finding. Quadratic voting for resource allocation. Radical transparency. 'Rough consensus' not majority rule."

Revision should use:
- **Structured deliberation**: Not just voting, but discussion that surfaces reasons
- **Consensus-mapping**: Tools that visualize areas of agreement and disagreement
- **Expert input phases**: Technical knowledge integrated into deliberation
- **Participation thresholds**: Sybil-resistant, open to all legitimate constituents

## Principle 22: Certification

**Certified systems receive preferential treatment; non-certified face restrictions.**

### Carrots and Sticks

From Panel 6's enforcement analysis:

> "Make democracy cheaper and extraction expensive through regulation, procurement, liability."

Certification creates market incentives for compliance:

**Preferential treatment for certified systems**:
- Eligible for public procurement (governments buy only certified AI)
- Partnership with municipal networks
- Reduced liability exposure (compliance is defense against claims)
- Reputational benefits (certification as quality signal)

**Restrictions for non-certified systems**:
- Procurement bans (excluded from government contracts)
- Increased regulatory scrutiny
- Greater civil liability exposure
- Reputational costs

### Without Requiring Universal Agreement

Not everyone must agree to the constitution for certification to matter. If enough municipalities, governments, and procurement processes require certification, market pressure drives compliance. Companies that want access to these markets must comply—regardless of their personal views on democratic governance.

## Principle 23: Enforcement Mechanisms

**Multiple reinforcing mechanisms: regulatory penalties, civil liability, collective bargaining pressure, municipal non-adoption, algorithmic audits, cultural stigma.**

### Why Multiple Mechanisms

From Panel 6:

> "No single enforcement mechanism is sufficient. Any single one can be captured or circumvented. Multiple mechanisms reinforce each other."

**Regulatory penalties**: Fines, operational restrictions, required remediation. Government enforcement with legal authority.

**Civil liability**: Private right of action for harms from non-compliant systems. Affected parties can sue.

**Collective bargaining**: Unions and creator organizations refuse to work with non-compliant systems. Labor power.

**Municipal non-adoption**: City networks refuse to deploy or integrate non-compliant systems. Market exclusion.

**Algorithmic audits**: Independent technical assessment with public reporting. Transparency enforcement.

**Cultural stigma**: Social disapproval of companies that violate constitutional principles. Reputational costs, talent recruitment difficulty.

### Reinforcement

These mechanisms reinforce each other:
- Regulatory penalties make civil liability easier to prove (violation = evidence)
- Municipal non-adoption creates market pressure for certification
- Cultural stigma affects talent recruitment (engineers don't want to work for bad actors)
- Collective bargaining provides organized power behind other mechanisms
- Algorithmic audits generate evidence for all other mechanisms

## Principle 24: Coalition Power

**Enforced through organized coalitions: tech workers, creators, labor, civil society, municipal networks. Architecture alone insufficient.**

### Rules Need Power

From Panel 6's synthesis:

> "Architecture matters—good rules make enforcement easier. But rules without organized power behind them are suggestions. Power requires coalition: diverse groups finding common cause."

The constitution is enforced by organized people:

**Tech workers**: Can refuse to build systems that violate principles, organize within companies, blow whistles, change jobs to ethical alternatives.

**Creators**: Can withhold content from non-compliant training, collectively license through democratic terms, refuse to create for non-compliant systems.

**Labor**: Can negotiate AI deployment terms in contracts, strike over violations, organize across industries.

**Civil society**: Can mobilize public pressure, coordinate campaigns, provide monitoring, support legal challenges.

**Municipal networks**: Can create alternative infrastructure, demonstrate different possibilities, exclude non-compliant systems.

### Target Scale

From Panel 6's coalition analysis:

> "50-100 cities + 1M+ creators + 100K+ workers = companies must comply or lose access to markets, talent, content, infrastructure."

This is the threshold where coalition power becomes undeniable. Below it, corporations can route around resistance. Above it, compliance is the path of least resistance.

### Building Coalition

From Panel 7's action guidance:

> "DON'T DO THIS ALONE. Highest leverage is building/strengthening coalitions. Every decision: does this help diverse groups coordinate? Does this build collective power? This is 5-10 year commitment minimum."

Constitutional principles are starting points. Coalition-building is the work.

## Amendment Process

### Genesis Ratification

The initial constitution is ratified through:
1. **Publication**: Full text available for review (30 days)
2. **Deliberation**: Open discussion, questions, proposed modifications
3. **Conviction voting**: Time-weighted commitment (longer commitment = more weight)
4. **Threshold**: Simple majority of participating voters with minimum participation
5. **Ratification**: If threshold met, constitution activates

### Standard Amendment

After genesis, amendments follow:
1. **Proposal**: Any participant can propose
2. **Deliberation**: Minimum 7-day discussion period
3. **Voting**: 2/3 supermajority required
4. **Implementation**: 14-day period before taking effect
5. **Documentation**: All records permanently preserved

### Emergency Amendment

For urgent safety:
1. **Emergency flag**: Detailed justification required
2. **Expedited deliberation**: 48-hour minimum
3. **Higher threshold**: 3/4 supermajority
4. **Automatic sunset**: Expires after 90 days unless ratified through standard process

### Unamendable Provisions

These cannot be amended without dissolving and reconstituting the entire constitution:
- Principle 1 (Agency Preservation)
- Principle 2 (Collective Governance)
- Principle 21 (Adaptive Cycles)

These are load-bearing walls. They define what "this constitution" means. Everything else can evolve; these establish identity.
