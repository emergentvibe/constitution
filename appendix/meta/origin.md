# Constitution Origin

## Version

**v1.1-draft** (2026-02-01)

Status: Awaiting ratification

## Source

These constitutional principles synthesize academic literature across multiple disciplines to address the question:

> What infrastructure does collective intelligence need to emerge healthy instead of cancerous?

### Research Foundation

The constitution draws on 68 academic sources spanning:

- **Superorganisms and collective entities**: Wilson, DeLanda, Gilbert
- **Game theory and coordination failure**: Schelling, Axelrod, Ostrom, Yudkowsky
- **AI power and political economy**: Crawford, Winner
- **Neurodiversity and pathologization**: Walker, Jensen, Foucault
- **Agency and determinism**: Dennett, Sapolsky, Buddhist philosophy
- **Commons governance**: Ostrom, Graeber
- **Democratic AI governance**: vTaiwan documentation, Anthropic experiments, OECD frameworks
- **Social movements and change**: Piven & Cloward, Pérez

### Process

1. **Literature synthesis**: Survey of academic work on coordination, governance, agency, and AI
2. **Framework development**: Identification of core tensions and convergences across disciplines
3. **Principle extraction**: 24 principles addressing documented problems with grounded solutions
4. **Restructuring** (v1.1): Unified prose document with appendix reasoning

### Core Question

The investigation began with: "What is selfing humanity, and can we steer it toward flourishing rather than extraction?"

The answer: yes, through organized coalition power deploying democratic governance mechanisms at multiple scales. Architecture matters, but rules without power behind them are suggestions.
