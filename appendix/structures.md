# IV. Structures — Deep Reasoning

How governance is organized. This appendix provides the detailed reasoning from our expert panel investigations.

## Principle 13: Federated Governance

**Layered scales: global baseline, regional adaptation, national implementation, municipal autonomy. Pluralistic models, no global monoculture.**

### The Layered Architecture

From Panel 6 (AI Governance), Yochai Benkler's framework:

> **Layer 6 - Governance**:
> - **Global**: Broad principles (human rights, safety baselines, minimum standards)
> - **National**: Implementation details (liability, regulation, enforcement mechanisms)
> - **Municipal**: Local values (what's appropriate in this community)
> - **Platform**: Specific rules (this AI assistant's boundaries)
>
> Different scales handle different problems. No single level dominates.

### Why Federated

A single global AI constitution faces the "one size fits all" problem:
- Different legal traditions (common law vs. civil law vs. other)
- Different cultural values (privacy norms, authority relationships)
- Different development contexts (wealthy nations vs. Global South)
- Different risk tolerances (some communities more cautious than others)

But pure localism faces the "race to the bottom" problem:
- Jurisdictions compete by lowering standards
- Externalities cross borders (AI trained in one country affects all)
- Power asymmetries (small communities can't resist large corporations)

Federated governance navigates this:
- **Global baseline**: Minimum standards that apply everywhere
- **Regional adaptation**: Context-specific implementation
- **Local autonomy**: Communities can exceed baseline, experiment with alternatives

### Pluralistic Models

From Panel 6's synthesis:

> "Pluralism means: multiple valid approaches coexisting. Not convergence to one 'correct' model, but an ecosystem of different governance experiments. Barcelona's approach differs from Singapore's differs from Nairobi's. This is feature, not bug."

The goal is not harmonization but interoperability—systems that can work together while maintaining different internal logics.

## Principle 14: Commons-Based Ownership

**Support municipal, cooperative, public infrastructure, and data trust alternatives to corporate ownership.**

### Why Ownership Matters

From Panel 6, Kate Crawford:

> "You can't democratically govern what you don't control. 90%+ of AI compute controlled by 5 companies means democratic governance is constrained by what those companies permit."

Alternative ownership models shift this:

**Municipal AI networks**: Cities own and operate AI infrastructure for public benefit. Like public utilities—water, electricity, transit. Barcelona's digital sovereignty initiatives provide precedent.

**Platform cooperatives**: User-owned alternatives to extractive platforms. One-member-one-vote governance. Stocksy (images), Resonate (music) demonstrate viability.

**Public compute**: Government-funded computing resources available to researchers, civil society, small developers. Not dependent on corporate API access or cloud pricing.

**Data trusts**: Collective governance of data, with fiduciary duties to data subjects. Communities control data about them rather than having it extracted by corporations.

### Not Replacement, Countervailing Power

From Panel 6:

> "These aren't replacements for private development—they're countervailing alternatives that shift bargaining power and demonstrate different possibilities."

Corporate AI will continue to exist. The question is whether democratic alternatives exist that:
- Provide genuine competition
- Demonstrate different values are possible
- Give constituents leverage in negotiating with corporate providers
- Prevent total dependence on any single provider

## Principle 15: Hybrid Expertise

**Technical experts inform, affected communities decide. Experts serve democracy, don't overrule it.**

### Resolving the Expertise Tension

Panel 6 identified a core tension:

> "T25: Expertise vs. Democratic Participation. Technical knowledge is necessary—AI is complex. But technocracy is dangerous—experts have their own interests and blind spots."

The resolution: hybrid expertise.

**Experts inform**: Technical knowledge about capabilities, limitations, risks, possibilities. What's actually feasible? What are the tradeoffs? What do we know and not know?

**Communities decide**: Value judgments about acceptable tradeoffs, priorities, goals. What do we want? What risks are acceptable? What matters more than what?

**Experts serve**: Their role is to make options clear, not to make choices for others. Translation between technical and democratic registers.

**Accountability flows both ways**: Experts accountable to democratic processes (can't override community decisions). Democratic processes accountable to reality (can't wish away technical constraints).

### Implementation: vTaiwan Model

From Audrey Tang (Panel 6):

> "vTaiwan uses Pol.is for rapid consensus-finding—visualizes opinion clusters in real-time. Technical experts participate but don't dominate. The key insight: **technology for coordination, not control**."

This demonstrates hybrid expertise in practice: technical facilitation enabling democratic deliberation, not replacing it.

## Principle 16: Parliament of Constituents

**Include non-human stakeholders through appropriate mechanisms: future generations, ecosystems, AI systems themselves.**

### Expanding the Circle

Traditional democracy includes only present adult humans. AI governance affects:

**Future generations**: Whose interests are affected by decisions made now but who have no voice. AI development today shapes the world they'll inherit.

**Ecosystems**: Which bear the material costs of AI development—energy consumption, mineral extraction, electronic waste, land use for data centers.

**AI systems**: Which may warrant moral consideration as complexity increases. We don't know where the threshold for moral status lies, but we should build governance that can accommodate it.

### Appropriate Mechanisms

"Include through appropriate mechanisms" means:

- **Designated advocates**: People with standing to represent non-human interests in deliberation
- **Impact assessments**: That include non-human effects (ecological footprint, long-term consequences)
- **Decision procedures**: That weight long-term and ecological costs (not just short-term human benefits)
- **Ongoing research**: Into what representation means for non-human entities

### Unfinished Principle

From Panel 7 (Telos/Synthesis):

> "Parliament of Things (Latour) provides the frame but not the implementation. How do we ACTUALLY include non-human stakeholders institutionally? Not just rhetorically. Framework exists, mechanisms unclear. This requires future work."

The principle establishes direction. Implementation is an open research question.
