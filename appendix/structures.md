How governance is organized.

## Principle 13: Federated Governance

**Layered scales: global baseline, regional adaptation, national implementation, municipal autonomy. Pluralistic models, no global monoculture.**

### The Problem

A single global AI constitution faces the "one size fits all" problem: different legal traditions, cultural values, development contexts, and risk tolerances. But pure localism creates a "race to the bottom" where jurisdictions compete by lowering standards.

Ostrom (1990) documented successful commons governance through "nested enterprises"—governance at multiple scales, each handling problems appropriate to that scale [S40].

### The Response

Federated governance navigates this:
- **Global baseline**: Minimum standards applying everywhere (human rights, safety thresholds)
- **Regional adaptation**: Context-specific implementation
- **National implementation**: Sovereign authority over AI deployment
- **Municipal autonomy**: Cities can exceed baseline and experiment

Taiwan's vTaiwan demonstrates national-scale digital democracy [S63]. Barcelona's digital sovereignty initiatives show municipal AI governance [documented in S66]. The OECD framework (2025) provides structure for multi-level coordination [S66].

## Principle 14: Commons-Based Ownership

**Support municipal, cooperative, public infrastructure, and data trust alternatives to corporate ownership.**

### The Problem

Crawford (2021) documents extreme concentration in AI infrastructure [S25]. Democratic governance of what corporations control requires their permission—a structural asymmetry.

Graeber (2011) and Graeber & Wengrow (2021) show that alternative economic arrangements have existed throughout history—current arrangements are not natural or inevitable [S42, S43].

### The Response

Alternative ownership models shift the structural dynamics:
- **Municipal AI networks**: Cities own infrastructure like utilities
- **Platform cooperatives**: User-owned alternatives to extractive platforms [S47]
- **Public compute**: Government-funded resources not dependent on corporate access
- **Data trusts**: Collective governance of data with fiduciary duties

The Harvard Ash Center (2024) documents working models of cooperative AI ownership [S67]. These aren't replacements for private development—they're countervailing alternatives that shift bargaining power.

## Principle 15: Hybrid Expertise

**Technical experts inform, affected communities decide. Experts serve democracy, don't overrule it.**

### The Problem

AI governance requires technical knowledge—capabilities, limitations, risks. But technocracy is dangerous: experts have their own interests and blind spots.

Foucault (1961) traced how expert knowledge becomes a tool of social control [S15]. Cohen (2016) extends this analysis to contemporary psychiatry [S16]. The question is how to use expertise without being captured by it.

### The Response

Hybrid expertise:
- **Experts inform**: Technical knowledge about what's possible and what's risky
- **Communities decide**: Value judgments about acceptable tradeoffs
- **Experts serve**: Their role is to clarify options, not make choices for others
- **Accountability flows both ways**: Experts accountable to democratic processes; democratic processes accountable to reality

Taiwan's vTaiwan demonstrates this in practice: technical facilitation enables democratic deliberation without replacing it [S63]. Anthropic's Collective Constitutional AI (2024) shows expert-public collaboration in AI development [S64].

## Principle 16: Parliament of Constituents

**Include non-human stakeholders through appropriate mechanisms: future generations, ecosystems, AI systems themselves.**

### The Problem

Traditional democracy includes only present adult humans. But AI governance affects:
- **Future generations**: Who inherit consequences of current decisions
- **Ecosystems**: Which bear material costs of AI development [S25]
- **AI systems**: Which may warrant moral consideration as complexity increases

Morton (2013) describes "hyperobjects"—entities massively distributed in time and space that we cannot perceive directly, like climate change or AI's planetary footprint [S32].

### The Response

"Appropriate mechanisms" means:
- Designated advocates with standing to represent non-human interests
- Impact assessments that include non-human effects
- Decision procedures that weight long-term and ecological costs
- Ongoing research into what representation means for non-human entities

Graeber & Wengrow (2021) document diverse historical arrangements for representing the interests of future generations, ancestors, and non-human entities [S43]. The principle establishes direction; implementation remains an open question.
