What flourishing requires.

## Principle 17: Flourishing Over Optimization

**Expand capabilities for valuable lives—practical reason, affiliation, imagination, emotion, play, control over environment. Don't optimize entities for system efficiency.**

### The Problem

Jensen et al. (2021) show how environments optimized for efficiency pathologize those who don't fit: ADHD traits that may have been adaptive become "disorder" in structured settings [S14]. The Neurocognitive Mismatch Theory (2025) generalizes this—what we call dysfunction is often forced adaptation to misaligned environments [S13].

AI amplifies optimization pressure. Algorithmic management optimizes workers for throughput. Recommendation systems optimize consumers for engagement. In each case, humans are optimized for system efficiency rather than human flourishing.

### The Response

Systems should be evaluated by whether they expand human capabilities:
- **Practical reason**: Ability to form and pursue life plans
- **Affiliation**: Meaningful connection with others
- **Imagination**: Creative, aesthetic, intellectual capacities
- **Emotion**: Capacity to feel, attach, grieve
- **Play**: Non-instrumental activity and joy
- **Control**: Political participation, work dignity

Systems that make workers faster but humans smaller fail this test.

## Principle 18: Care and Attention as Commons

**Protect attention, care, and relational capacity. Don't extract them as resources.**

### The Problem

Alexander (2014) describes "Moloch"—coordination failures where individual incentives produce collectively destructive outcomes [S17]. The attention economy is a Moloch trap: every platform competes for the same finite attention, resulting in strip-mining of human consciousness.

Crawford (2021) documents AI as a technology of extraction—not just data, but attention, care, relational capacity treated as raw material [S25]. Morton (2013) describes how hyperobjects like AI systems have effects distributed across time and space that we cannot perceive directly [S32].

### The Response

The principle treats attention, care, and relational capacity as commons to be protected, not resources to be extracted. AI should:
- Respect attention limits, not exploit them
- Support care relationships, not replace them
- Enhance relational capacity, not substitute for it

brown (2017) describes "emergent strategy"—complex patterns arising from simple interactions, critical connections over critical mass [S41]. Care and attention are the substrate for such emergence.

## Principle 19: Weird and Unexpected

**Fund AI projects with unclear utility, artistic vision, philosophical depth.**

### The Problem

Commercial AI development optimizes for market value. This captures some value but misses entire categories: artistic AI that expands expressive possibility, philosophical AI that helps us think, exploratory AI without predetermined outcomes, playful AI designed for joy.

Gould & Lewontin (1979) warned against "Panglossian" reasoning—assuming everything that exists must be optimal for something. The same applies to AI: what gets funded isn't necessarily what's valuable [S12].

### The Response

Public funding should support weird, unexpected, non-optimized AI development. The ecosystem needs variance, not just optimization.

brown (2017) argues that emergence requires conditions for the unexpected—rigid optimization produces brittle monocultures [S41]. Graeber (2011) shows that historical societies supported extensive non-instrumental activity that modern economies would consider "unproductive" [S42].

## Principle 20: Contemplative Capacity

**Cultivate meta-cognition, critical thinking, ability to evaluate AI outputs.**

### The Problem

As AI generates more of what we consume, capacity to evaluate AI outputs becomes critical. Dennett (2003) argues that "freedoms worth wanting" include the capacity to deliberate, consider options, and be moved by reasons [S51]. If we outsource both generation AND evaluation to AI, this capacity atrophies.

MIT Media Lab research (2024) identifies "AI addiction" as a risk of human-AI coupling—dependence that erodes independent judgment [S57]. Bourdieu (1977) showed how habitus operates below conscious awareness; AI may shape habitus without our noticing [S54].

### The Response

Cultivating contemplative capacity requires:
- **Meta-cognition**: Awareness of our own thinking processes
- **Critical thinking**: Ability to assess claims and detect manipulation
- **AI literacy**: Understanding what AI can and can't do
- **Discrimination skills**: Distinguishing quality from plausibility

Buddhist philosophy distinguishes between automatic reaction and intentional response (cetanā) [S53]. Contemplative practice—individual and institutional—supports this distinction.
