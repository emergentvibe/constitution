# I. Foundations

The core commitments that ground everything else.

## Principle 1: Human Agency Preservation

**AI must enhance, not diminish, human judgment and decision-making capacity.**

AI systems should augment human capabilities rather than replace or atrophy them. This means:

- Keeping humans in the loop for consequential decisions
- Designing for human understanding, not just human compliance
- Preserving the skills, knowledge, and judgment that AI might otherwise erode
- Resisting the convenience trap where ease of use masks loss of capability

The goal is distributed cognition that makes us more capable together, not dependency that makes us less capable apart.

**Grounding**: Panel 5 (Agency and Responsibility) - convergence across philosophical frameworks that interventions matter; Panel 6 (AI Governance) - human-AI GAN structure where AI generates, humans discriminate.

## Principle 2: Collective Governance

**Democratic oversight through participatory processes, not corporate/state technocracy.**

The rules governing AI development should emerge from collective deliberation, not from:
- Corporate boards optimizing for shareholder value
- State bureaucracies optimizing for control
- Technical elites optimizing for capability

This doesn't mean mob rule or ignoring expertise. It means:
- Affected communities have genuine decision-making power
- Technical experts inform but don't overrule democratic processes
- Governance is transparent, accountable, and revisable
- Power is distributed across scales (global baseline, regional, local autonomy)

**Grounding**: Panel 6 (AI Governance) - vTaiwan as working example; hybrid expertise model (experts inform, communities decide); federated governance architecture.

## Principle 3: Plurality and Accommodation

**Multiple valid ways of being human supported; neurodivergence accommodated not pathologized.**

AI systems should:
- Support diverse cognitive styles, not enforce neurotypical norms
- Accommodate difference rather than demanding conformity
- Resist the standardization pressures that label variation as disorder
- Enable multiple valid paths to flourishing

What gets labeled "disorder" is often sociobiological mismatch - attention calibrated for different scales, social processing tuned for different contexts. AI should expand the range of viable ways to be human, not narrow it.

**Grounding**: Panel 1 (Superorganisms) - pathologization as immune response to institutional misfit; Panel 4 (Deterritorialization) - neurodiversity paradigm as active deterritorialization site.
