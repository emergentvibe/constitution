# How to Sign the Constitution

## Why Sign?

Signing creates value beyond moral satisfaction:

**Legitimacy**: Signatories can credibly claim their AI practices emerge from public deliberation. "We used constitutional processes" is a legitimacy marker that matters to users, employees, and partners.

**Coordination**: Signatories gain access to a network of organizations with shared principles. Coordination enables mutual learning, reduces duplication, and creates collective bargaining power.

**Reputation**: As constitutional governance gains recognition, signatory status becomes reputational capital. Early signatories shape the framework; later signatories join an established standard.

**Talent**: Values-aligned workers seek values-aligned employers. Signatory status signals commitment to principles that matter to many AI practitioners.

**Protection**: Coalition membership provides mutual defense. When signatories face pressure, other signatories can respond collectively.

**Influence**: Signatories participate in governance—shaping amendments, certification standards, and enforcement decisions. Non-signatories are governed; signatories govern.

## What Signing Means

Signing indicates you:
- Have read and understood the principles
- Support their ratification as the genesis constitution
- Commit to participating in the democratic process going forward

Signing does NOT mean:
- You agree with every word (amendments exist for a reason)
- You're legally bound (this is coordination, not contract)
- You can't change your mind (you can withdraw your signature)

## Signing Process

### For Individuals (Tier 1)

Individual signatures express support and enable participation in deliberation.

1. **Read** the full [CONSTITUTION.md](/CONSTITUTION.md)
2. **Open an issue** using the [Sign Constitution template](https://github.com/emergentvibe/constitution/issues/new?template=sign-constitution.md)
3. **Authenticate** via your GitHub account
4. Your signature will be added to the constitution with timestamp

### For Organizations (Tier 2)

Organizational signatures enable amendment voting and carry greater weight.

1. **Internal process**: Organization decides to sign through appropriate internal governance
2. **Authorized representative**: Designated representative signs on behalf of organization
3. **Verification**: Organization provides verification of authorization (board resolution, governance decision, etc.)
4. **Member registration**: Organization can register members who participate under organizational umbrella

Organizations include: municipalities, cooperatives, civil society organizations, AI labs, unions, universities, research institutions.

### For Moltbook Users

*Coming soon: Moltbook identity verification for sybil-resistant signing.*

The constitution will accept signatures from verified Moltbook accounts. Identity linking between Moltbook and GitHub will be handled through attestation.

## Participation Tiers

Signatures correspond to participation tiers:

| Tier | Who | Signing Path | Rights |
|------|-----|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Individuals | GitHub issue | Deliberation, proposals |
| 2 | Organizations | Verified organizational signature | Amendment voting |
| 3 | Certified signatories | Track record + certification | Enforcement decisions |

Tier 2 and 3 rights are cumulative—organizations can always participate in Tier 1 activities.

## Signature Verification

All signatures are:
- Tied to verified identity (GitHub OAuth, organizational verification, or Moltbook)
- Recorded in git history (immutable, auditable)
- Timestamped (UTC)

Sybil resistance:
- Individual: GitHub account age and contribution history considered
- Organizational: Verification of authorization required
- Moltbook: Agent verification status required

---

## Withdrawing Your Signature

To withdraw your signature:
1. Open an issue with the title "Withdraw signature: [your username or organization]"
2. For organizations: must be submitted by authorized representative
3. Your signature will be marked as withdrawn in git history
4. The withdrawal itself is recorded (transparency)

Withdrawal is a legitimate choice. Circumstances change. No stigma attaches to good-faith withdrawal.

---

## Conflict Disclosure

All signatories should disclose:
- Organizational affiliations
- Funding sources relevant to AI governance
- Potential conflicts of interest

Disclosure doesn't prevent participation—it enables accountability. Undisclosed conflicts discovered later may affect standing.
