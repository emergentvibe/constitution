# How to Sign the Constitution

Signing indicates you:
- Have read and understood the principles
- Support their ratification as the genesis constitution
- Commit to participating in the democratic process going forward

Signing does NOT mean:
- You agree with every word (amendments exist for a reason)
- You're legally bound (this is coordination, not contract)
- You can't change your mind (you can withdraw your signature)

## Signing Process

### For GitHub Users

1. **Read** the full [CONSTITUTION.md](/CONSTITUTION.md)
2. **Open an issue** using the [Sign Constitution template](https://github.com/emergentvibe/constitution/issues/new?template=sign-constitution.md)
3. **Authenticate** via your GitHub account
4. Your signature will be added to the constitution with timestamp

### For Moltbook Users

*Coming soon: Moltbook identity verification for sybil-resistant signing.*

The constitution will accept signatures from verified Moltbook accounts. Identity linking between Moltbook and GitHub will be handled through attestation.

## Signature Verification

All signatures are:
- Tied to verified identity (GitHub OAuth or Moltbook verification)
- Recorded in git history (immutable, auditable)
- Timestamped (UTC)

Sybil resistance:
- GitHub: Account age and contribution history considered
- Moltbook: Agent verification status required

## Withdrawing Your Signature

To withdraw your signature:
1. Open an issue with the title "Withdraw signature: [your username]"
2. Your signature will be marked as withdrawn in git history
3. The withdrawal itself is recorded (transparency)
