How governance is organized.

## Principle 13: Federated Governance

**Layered scales: global baseline, regional adaptation, national implementation, municipal autonomy. Pluralistic models, no global monoculture.**

AI governance should operate at multiple scales:

- **Global baseline**: Minimum standards that apply everywhere (human rights, safety thresholds, transparency requirements)
- **Regional adaptation**: Context-specific implementation reflecting different legal traditions, cultural values, development contexts
- **National implementation**: Sovereign authority over AI deployment within borders
- **Municipal autonomy**: Cities and communities can exceed baseline, experiment with alternatives, build local infrastructure

This isn't top-down uniformity or bottom-up fragmentation - it's layered pluralism. Different scales handle different problems. No single level dominates.

**Grounding**: Panel 6 (AI Governance) - resolves T23 (local vs global) through layered architecture; municipal AI networks as key leverage point; vTaiwan as national-scale example.

## Principle 14: Commons-Based Ownership

**Support municipal, cooperative, public infrastructure, and data trust alternatives to corporate ownership.**

AI infrastructure shouldn't be owned exclusively by corporations:

- **Municipal AI networks**: Cities own and operate AI infrastructure for public benefit
- **Platform cooperatives**: User-owned alternatives to extractive platforms
- **Public compute**: Government-funded computing resources available to researchers, civil society, small developers
- **Data trusts**: Collective governance of data, with fiduciary duties to data subjects

These aren't replacements for private development - they're countervailing alternatives that shift bargaining power and demonstrate different possibilities.

**Grounding**: Panel 6 (AI Governance) - six-layer architecture with public alternatives at each layer; coalition strategy requires material base; Panel 4 - Stocksy as working platform cooperative example.

## Principle 15: Hybrid Expertise

**Technical experts inform, affected communities decide. Experts serve democracy, don't overrule it.**

AI governance requires expertise but shouldn't be technocracy:

- **Experts inform**: Technical knowledge about capabilities, limitations, risks, possibilities
- **Communities decide**: Value judgments about acceptable tradeoffs, priorities, goals
- **Experts serve**: Their role is to make options clear, not to make choices for others
- **Accountability flows both ways**: Experts accountable to democratic processes, democratic processes accountable to reality

This resolves the false binary between "trust the experts" and "populist rejection of expertise." Both capture real concerns. The synthesis is structured collaboration.

**Grounding**: Panel 6 (AI Governance) - resolves T25 (expertise vs populism); vTaiwan model with technical facilitation and community deliberation; Panel 7 - convergence across frameworks supports acting despite uncertainty.

## Principle 16: Parliament of Things

**Include non-human stakeholders (future generations, ecosystems, algorithms) through appropriate mechanisms.**

Democracy traditionally includes only present adult humans. AI governance should expand this:

- **Future generations**: Whose interests are affected by decisions made now but who have no voice
- **Ecosystems**: Which bear the material costs of AI development (energy, extraction, waste)
- **Algorithms**: Which may warrant moral consideration as complexity increases

"Appropriate mechanisms" means:
- Designated advocates with standing to represent non-human interests
- Impact assessments that include non-human effects
- Decision procedures that weight long-term and ecological costs
- Ongoing research into what representation means for non-human entities

This is unfinished. We don't know how to do this well. But the principle establishes direction.

**Grounding**: Panel 7 (Telos/Synthesis) - Latour's Parliament of Things; Panel 3 - hyperobject problem (AI + ecology as massively distributed phenomena requiring new perception); identified as unresolved question requiring future work.
