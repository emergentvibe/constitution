What flourishing requires.

## Principle 17: Flourishing Over Optimization

**Expand capabilities for valuable lives, not optimize humans for system efficiency.**

AI should be evaluated by whether it expands human capabilities, not by efficiency metrics:

- **Practical reason**: Ability to form and pursue life plans
- **Affiliation**: Meaningful connection with others, social bonds
- **Senses, imagination, thought**: Creative, aesthetic, intellectual capacities
- **Emotions**: Capacity to feel, to attach, to grieve
- **Play**: Non-instrumental activity, exploration, joy
- **Control over environment**: Political participation, property, work dignity

Systems that optimize humans for efficiency (faster workers, more compliant consumers, more predictable citizens) fail this test even if they "work."

**Grounding**: Panel 5 (Agency) - Nussbaum's capabilities approach as framework for flourishing; Panel 1 - pathologization as system optimizing humans for institutional fit rather than human flourishing.

## Principle 18: Care and Attention as Commons

**Protect attention, care, and relational capacity. Don't extract them as resources.**

Attention and care are not infinite resources to be harvested:

- **Attention**: Finite cognitive capacity being strip-mined by engagement optimization
- **Care**: Relational labor being devalued, automated, or extracted without reciprocity
- **Relational capacity**: Ability to form and maintain bonds, eroded by mediated interaction

AI systems should:
- Respect attention limits, not exploit them
- Support care relationships, not replace them
- Enhance relational capacity, not substitute for it

The attention economy treats human consciousness as raw material. This constitution treats it as sacred.

**Grounding**: Panel 4 (Algorithmic Attention) - attention capture as primary mechanism of hybrid selfhood; adversarial coupling between AI and human attention systems; Panel 1 - care as fundamental human capability being systematically degraded.

## Principle 19: Weird and Unexpected

**Fund AI projects with unclear utility, artistic vision, philosophical depth.**

Not all valuable AI development has clear commercial application:

- **Artistic AI**: Creative tools that expand expressive possibility
- **Philosophical AI**: Systems that help us think about hard questions
- **Exploratory AI**: Research without predetermined outcomes
- **Playful AI**: Systems designed for joy, not productivity

Public funding should support weird, unexpected, non-optimized AI development. The monoculture of commercial AI misses entire categories of value.

**Grounding**: Panel 6 (AI Governance) - weird AI funding as recommendation; democratic governance enables values beyond profit; Panel 5 - play as fundamental capability.

## Principle 20: Contemplative Capacity

**Cultivate meta-cognition, critical thinking, ability to evaluate AI outputs.**

As AI generates more of what we consume, human capacity to evaluate AI outputs becomes critical:

- **Meta-cognition**: Awareness of our own thinking processes
- **Critical thinking**: Ability to assess claims, detect manipulation, reason carefully
- **AI literacy**: Understanding what AI can and can't do, how it works, where it fails
- **Discrimination skills**: Ability to distinguish quality, accuracy, value

This isn't about making everyone a computer scientist. It's about maintaining the human discriminator function in the human-AI GAN. If we can't evaluate AI outputs, we can't steer AI development.

**Grounding**: Panel 5 (Agency) - GAN structure requires human discriminator function; contemplative practice as individual-level intervention; Panel 6 - AI literacy as educational priority; Panel 7 - this investigation as example of human-AI discrimination.
