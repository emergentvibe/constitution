# Constitution Origin

## Version

**v1.0-genesis** (2026-01-25)

Status: Awaiting ratification

## Source

These constitutional principles emerged from **Investigation 2: The Superorganism and Its Selves**, conducted through the ai-symposium multi-panel deliberation framework.

### Investigation Statistics

- **Panels**: 7
- **Experts consulted**: 46 (44 unique)
- **Recommendations synthesized**: 95
- **Tensions identified**: 27 (4 unresolved)
- **Academic sources**: 80
- **Date range**: 2026-01-24 to 2026-01-25

### Panel Arc

1. **Superorganisms and the Selfing Function** - How collective systems produce individual selves
2. **Game Theory / Nash Equilibrium** - Why coordination failures persist (Moloch dynamics)
3. **The Race** - Timeline uncertainty (5-15 years vs 20-50 years) and AI acceleration
4. **Deterritorialization Sites** - Where change is happening (education, psychiatric, digital-attention)
5. **Agency and Responsibility** - Can we act under uncertainty? (Convergent yes)
6. **AI Governance** - Concrete democratic architecture
7. **Telos and Synthesis** - Where does the cyborg superorganism go?

### Key Theoretical Frameworks

- **Hacking**: Interactive kinds, looping effects
- **Gazzaniga**: Interpreter module, narrative self
- **Nussbaum**: Capabilities approach
- **Ostrom**: Commons governance
- **DeLanda**: Assemblage theory
- **Boyd**: Gene-culture coevolution
- **Latour**: Parliament of Things

### Core Finding

Six mechanisms "self" humanity simultaneously: biological/cognitive, game-theoretic, technological, historical, distributed agency, and architectural. Current assemblages tend toward territorialization, extraction, concentration, and acceleration. Democratic steering is possible through organized coalition power operating at high-leverage intervention points.

## Unresolved Questions

Carried forward from Investigation 2:

1. **Timeline uncertainty (T9)**: 5-15 years to lock-in vs 20-50 years. Won't know until too late.

2. **Parliament of Things implementation**: How to ACTUALLY include non-human stakeholders institutionally?

3. **Cooptation resistance mechanisms (T15)**: We know cooptation happens. Mechanisms to prevent it remain uncertain.

4. **Mirowski's critique**: Is "democratic AI" conceptually distinct from neoliberalized participation?

## Acknowledgment

This constitution was not invented from scratch. It distills findings from rigorous interdisciplinary research, synthesized through structured multi-expert deliberation. The principles are grounded in academic literature, historical evidence, and ongoing empirical developments.

It is also incomplete. The constitutional process exists precisely because no initial document can anticipate everything. The principles establish direction; collective deliberation refines the path.
