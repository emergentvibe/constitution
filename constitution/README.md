# The Constitution

This directory contains the living constitution for democratic AI governance.

## Structure

- `principles/` - The 24 constitutional principles organized by section
- `meta/` - How the constitution itself works (amendment process, enforcement, versioning)

## Current Version

**v1.0-genesis** - Awaiting ratification through conviction voting

## How This Works

1. **Genesis Ratification**: The seed constitution (v1.0) is ratified through 30-day conviction voting
2. **Amendments**: After ratification, changes require 2/3 supermajority + 7-day deliberation
3. **Regular Review**: Participatory revision every 2 years using deliberative democracy tools

## Origin

These principles emerged from Investigation 2 of the memetic-self research project:
- 7 panels of multi-expert deliberation
- 46 experts consulted across disciplines
- 95 recommendations synthesized
- 80 academic sources grounding the analysis

The constitution is not invented from scratch - it's distilled from rigorous interdisciplinary research on how minds work, how coordination fails, and how democratic governance can shape AI development.
