# Signatories

Those who have signed the Genesis Constitution (v1.0), affirming their support for these principles.

---

## How to Sign

1. **Authenticate** via GitHub OAuth
2. **Read** the full constitution (all 24 principles)
3. **Sign** with your GitHub identity
4. Your signature is recorded with timestamp and remains in git history

Signing indicates you:
- Have read and understood the principles
- Support their ratification as the genesis constitution
- Commit to participating in the democratic process going forward

Signing does NOT mean:
- You agree with every word (amendments exist for a reason)
- You're legally bound (this is coordination, not contract)
- You can't change your mind (you can withdraw your signature)

## Signature Verification

All signatures are:
- Tied to GitHub OAuth identity (sybil-resistant via account age/contribution requirements)
- Recorded in git history (immutable, auditable)
- Timestamped (UTC)

The signatories list is the precursor to conviction voting. Once the voting system is live, signatures convert to initial votes in the 30-day ratification period.
