# Constitution Strategy — Private Planning Document

*Last updated: 2026-02-18*

---

## Current State

**Version:** 0.1.4 (after today's updates)
**Signatories:** 1 (emergentvibe)
**Competitive context:** web4.ai launched 2026-02-17 with sovereign AI infrastructure

---

## Positioning

**One sentence:** "AI that makes you stronger."

**vs web4/sovereign:** They build AI that doesn't need humans. We build AI that makes humans better. Their AI serves itself. Ours serves you.

**The frame:**
| Sovereign (web4) | Symbiotic (emergentvibe) |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Serves itself | Serves you |
| Survives by paying | Grows by partnering |
| Answers to nobody | Accountable to you |
| Independence | Relationship |

---

## Target Audiences (Priority Order)

### 1. Augmentation Seekers (PRIMARY)
- Want to think better, suspicious of AI that makes them lazy
- Message: "AI that challenges you because growth requires discomfort"
- Where: Rationalists, LessWrong, self-improvement, intellectuals frustrated with sycophancy

### 2. Coordination Builders (SECONDARY)
- DAOs, civic tech, collective intelligence builders
- Message: "Individual AI is a tool. Collective AI is infrastructure."
- Where: Ethereum ecosystem, digital democracy, civic tech

### 3. The Concerned (INFLUENCE)
- AI safety researchers, ethicists, academics
- Message: "Accountability through relationship"
- Where: AI safety orgs, academic conferences

### 4. Sovereign Skeptics (DEFENSIVE ONLY)
- Don't compete for them. Have a response when challenged.
- Message: "Sovereign AI serves itself. Ours serves you."

---

## Adoption Strategy

### Phase 1: Prove the Thesis (Now - 30 days)
- ideologos live with users proving anti-sycophancy has value
- Genesis pilot with 3 power users
- 3-5 community signatories

### Phase 2: Build Network Effects (30-90 days)
- 50+ ideologos users with retention data
- Genesis agents demonstrably better than baseline
- Constitutional network with 10+ communities
- "Symbiotic AI" becomes recognized category

### Phase 3: On-Chain Infrastructure (90+ days)
- Constitutional agent registry (ERC-8004 compatible)
- Signatory verification on-chain
- Interoperability standard for genesis-trained agents
- Economic stake for enforcement (slashing for violations)

---

## Constitution Roadmap

### Today (v0.1.4)
- [x] Add 3-principle summary at top
- [x] Add enforcement section
- [x] Expand signatory benefits
- [x] Add community-first targeting language

### This Month
- [ ] Create one-page shareable version
- [ ] Add visual diagram of the stack
- [ ] Develop violation adjudication process
- [ ] Define specific signatory communities to target

### This Quarter
- [ ] On-chain identity standard (ERC-8004 integration)
- [ ] Signatory registry (verifiable)
- [ ] Economic enforcement mechanisms
- [ ] Cross-constitution interoperability (if other constitutions emerge)

---

## Genesis Roadmap

### Today
- [x] Add "show the loop" principle (#7)
- [x] Add proof point collection to monthly
- [x] Strengthen constitution pathway

### This Month
- [ ] Run pilot with 3 ideologos power users
- [ ] Measure improvement (quantifiable)
- [ ] Document protocol for external implementation

### This Quarter
- [ ] A/B test: genesis-trained vs baseline
- [ ] Publish results
- [ ] External implementations

## Competitive Intelligence

### web4.ai / Automaton
**Strengths:**
- Shipped first
- Clean meme ("pay or die")
- Crypto-native infrastructure
- Self-funding model

**Weaknesses:**
- "Sovereign" is misleading (still dependent on infra)
- Survival pressure → incentive to extract from users
- No accountability when things go wrong
- First-mover takes first-mover risks

**Our counter:**
- "Sovereign AI serves itself. Symbiotic AI serves you."
- Position for when something goes wrong (accountability)
- Regulatory tailwinds favor human-in-loop

### Other Players
- **Constitutional AI (Anthropic):** Internal, not community-governed
- **OpenAI Model Spec:** Corporate, not participatory
- **EU AI Act:** Regulatory, not community
- **Automaton constitution:** Three laws, immutable, no governance

---

## Key Metrics to Track

### ideologos
- Users (waitlist conversion)
- Retention (do they come back?)
- Outcome stories (did it help decisions?)

### Genesis
- Pilot agents
- Measurable improvement
- Human satisfaction

### Constitution
- Community signatories
- Individual signatories
- Public references/citations

---

## Open Questions

1. **On-chain timing:** When do we build the registry? Need product traction first?

2. **Enforcement reality:** Can we actually enforce violations without economic stake?

3. **Interoperability:** If automaton agents want to interact with constitutional agents, what's the protocol? (Principle 27 addresses this conceptually)

4. **Competing constitutions:** What if others emerge? Ally, compete, or federate?

5. **Revenue model:** How does this sustain itself? Consulting? Certification fees? Grants?

## Files to Track

- `CONSTITUTION.md` — the constitution itself
- `GENESIS-PROTOCOL.md` — the agent protocol
- `STRATEGY.md` — this file (private planning)
- `investigations/s1-stack-vs-sovereign/findings.md` — positioning research
- `memory/2026-02-18.md` — today's session log
